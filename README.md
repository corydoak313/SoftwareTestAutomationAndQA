How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure my code is functional, running tests as the code is written will be best to keep errors minimal and minute to correct. Practices such   as avoiding shortcuts, minification, and obfuscation will help keep code from being vulnerable to attackers and bugs. 
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Meeting with clients and getting their software requirements is just the starting point of software development. Understanding their              requirements and their need for them will aid in building them into the software. Aligning them in order of their priority allows developers to   know where to begin their process. Tools such as flow charts and mind maps help keep this type of information organized.
  
How do I approach designing software?
 As mentioned, a meeting with the clients is the beginning. After this, getting an understanding of their requirements and then having them presented on a flow chart or mind map will help keep the project simple and organized. Using these tools amongst many others will minimize overload and stress that could build up quickly in more complex projects.
